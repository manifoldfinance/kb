## Reading this documentation

-   Guides, for broad hands-on understanding and connections to other learning resources
-   Tutorials, intended to teach a particular process or project
-   Cookbooks, collections of tips and tricks
-   Reference, full manuals and technical coverage
-   Pedias, for encyclopedic description

*   If information is more encyclopedic (with a similar scope and tone to pages on Wikipedia), a page would be considered a pedia.
*   If information is less encyclopedic and more similar to a compendium, study guide, or bibliographic guide, a page would be considered a guide.
*   If information is more about direct instruction to achieve a specific task, a page would be considered a tutorial.
*   If a page is more just a set of tips and tricks (less instructive than a tutorial), it would be a cookbook.
*   If a page is a detailed reference (like a man page or full software manual), it would fit under references.
