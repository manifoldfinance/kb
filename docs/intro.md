# Tutorial Intro

Let's discover **Docusaurus in less than 5 minutes**.

## Getting Started

Get started by **creating a new site**.

Or **try Docusaurus immediately** with **[docusaurus.new](https://docusaurus.new)**.

### What you'll need

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 14 or above:
    -   When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.

## Generate a new page

Front matter quires the following 

```yaml
id: intro
```

## Start the development server

Run the development server:

```bash
cd my-website
npm run start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. To work with your newly created site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

Open `docs/intro.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes.
