## DictatorDAO Codebase

## Current Regime
However, if the Operator doesn’t perform as the DAO would like. DAO members can simply change their votes to another Operator. Once another operator gets over 50% of the votes, they will start to receive future auction funds and they will get access to the farming contract. This is all enforced by the smart contracts and cannot be changed/upgraded by the Operator.

So the DAO always retains ultimate control over the protocol. The DAO is the true owner of the protocol and they decide who to ‘hire’ to operate the protocol for them without ever giving up control.
