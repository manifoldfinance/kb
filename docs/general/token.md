# FOLD Token

This document describes the model for which we reason on token mechanics. It is by this model and frame of reference that we draw mechanics to which to implement ontop of the the underlying instrument, i.e. the FOLD token. Mechanics of the FOLD token are discussed within the context of the "version 2" model.

## Determining the Token Viability Model

> Every protocol which can be forked will be forked into becoming a _hyperstructure_; unless these tokens either: govern capital and/or underwrite useful risk/facilitate the transfer of risk. -- Token Corollary Axiom

As the space trends towards efficiency, all tokens will trend towards 0. This principle is called the _zero-sum_ principle. They will be re-rated for the risks that they underwrite or adjusted for EV of capital owned. If they do not own capital or are not underwriting risk, then they are useless over the macro.

> All happy defi projects are different: each one earns a monopoly by solving a unique problem All failed defi projects are the same: they failed to escape competition" -- The Anna Karenina Principle

The Anna Karenina principle states that a deficiency in any one of a number of factors dooms an endeavor to failure. Consequently, a successful endeavor (subject to this principle) is one for which every possible deficiency has been avoided.[^1]
