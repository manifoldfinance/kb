> "The lethal variety attenuator is sheer ignorance."
>  - Stafford Beer

Variety grows exponentially with the size of organizations and major
systems, creating vast amounts of complexity in regard to its
interactions. Some real-world systems have levels of variety which are
effectively infinite. However, our perceptions attenuate (“filter-out”)
any variety which is irrelevant to what we are trying to observe.

The VBSM is an implementation of the Viable Systems Model for
decentralized blockchain networks with an emphasis on autonomy,
viability, and stability

In reaching a viable state, defined terms and sub-systems must be
formalized and specified. This section of the documentation is an effort in
trying to formalize such goals, objectives and key results that can be
achieved when a systems-based approach is combined with formal design
and mechanisms to achieve said goals.


# Sub Systems

> "Complexity is less the issue than inconsistency in an environment."

## System 1

Concerned with all the basic, primary operations of the organization,
which justify the existence of the system as a whole, and the management
of these operations.

## System 2

Deals with the inevitable problems which emerge as several autonomous, 
self-organizing operational parts interact. There will be
conflicts of interest that must be resolved. **System 2** is there to
harmonize the interactions, keep the peace, to deal with the
problems. **Without System 2, the system would shake itself to pieces.**

## System 3

Concerned with synergy. It looks at the entire interacting cluster of
operational units from its meta-systemic perspective and considers ways
to maximize its effectiveness through collaboration. System 3 ensures
the whole system works better than the operational parts working in
isolation. It represents all the structures that are put in place by
senior leadership to dictate rules, rights, resources and
responsibilities within System 1, and also to provide an interface for
interaction with Systems 4 and 5. This system represents the broad view
of all the operations activities within the first system. In simple terms,
it is the everyday control of the organization which is exerted by
senior leaders. There is little variety in the activities which
occur within the third system.

## System 4

Ensures the whole system can adapt to a rapidly changing and sometimes
hostile environment. It scans the outside world in which it operates,
looks for threats and opportunities, undertakes research and
simulations, and proposes plans to guide the system through the various
possible pathways it could follow. Without System 4, the system would
be unable to cope with the complexity of the external environment in
which it operates. In essence, it is responsible for looking externally
from the organization or overall system, at the environment in which it
operates, and establishing which factors may impact operations, and how
it needs to adapt to remain viable and sustainable. There are
also channels leading each way between System 4 and System 3, as any
necessary changes must be implemented through flow down towards the
Control systems, but also System 3 must provide information regarding
the organization in its current form. This allows System 4 to formulate
a clear model containing both the organization and the environment,
which forms the basis of adaptive strategies.

## System 5

Provides closure to the whole system. It defines and develops the vision
and values of the system through policies. System 5 creates the
identity, the ethos, and the ground rules under which everyone operates.
It aligns with the tasks of everyone in the organization.
**This is the system that holds the overall control,** though not necessarily directly, as it
forms the culture and values of the organization, and thus dictates
policy decisions that control all the below systems. This system
should always be maintained as separate from the control exerted by
System 3.

System 5 monitors the interaction between S3 and S4 to ensure all plans
are within policy guidelines. If not, it steps in and applies its
ultimate authority.

Systems 1, 2 and 3 between them make up the internal environment of the
viable system — the Inside and Now. The autonomous parts function in a
harmonizing internal environment which maximizes its effectiveness
through creating mutually supportive relationships.
