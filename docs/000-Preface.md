# Preface

As we progress into the third decade of the twenty-first century, our reliance on the digital infrastructure of computing and communications is growing dramatically.

It’s worth recognizing that we’re currently in a particular moment
in time, witnessing a new area of computer science blossom before our eyes in real time. It
draws on well-established parts of computer science (e.g., cryptography and distributed systems) and other fields (e.g., game theory and finance), but is developing into a fundamental and interdisciplinary area of science and engineering in its own right. Future generations of
computer scientists will be jealous of your opportunity to get in on the ground floor of this
new area—analogous to getting into the Internet and the Web in the early 1990s.

A surprising number of people, including a majority of computer science researchers and academics, have yet to grok
the modern vision of blockchains: a new computing paradigm with the potential to enable the next incarnation of the Internet and the Web, along with an entirely new generation of applications.
