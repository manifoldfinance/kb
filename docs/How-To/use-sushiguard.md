# Sushi Guard

## What does Sushi Guard do?

> MEV, Front running, and arbitrage Protection for Sushi users

**Sushi Guard protects you from ‚ÄòMEV‚Äô - Maximal Extractable Value.**

It is built using a service called OpenMEV from Manifold Finance.

**MEV** is the crypto-version of arbitrage trading / high-frequency trading that you typically see on Wall Street. Arbitrage bots are used to monitor the network, and when you submit a transaction, they will submit a transaction of their own and "bribe" the miner to place their transaction before yours and ten after your transaction. **This is called "Sandwich attack"**. It has the effect of manipulating price and volume and is used to make a profit from your trades.

Sushi Guard **mitigates this type of malicious MEV** by leveraging the power of [Flashbots](https://docs.flashbots.net), [Eden Network](https://edennetwork.io), and Manifold Finance's [OpenMEV](https://docs.openmev.org) network.


> ‚úÖ Sushi Guard protects traders from MEV: Maximal Extracted Value. MEV occurs when arbitrage bots see your transaction and use it to arbitrage against other users to _extract_ value from it.
